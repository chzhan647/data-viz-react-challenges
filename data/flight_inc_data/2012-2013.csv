The fuel imbalance was due to incomplete refueling and an ineffective preflight inspection by the pilot.  The imbalance was further complicated by an incorrectly assembled fuel transfer valve and motor combination.  

Contributing to the severity of the accident was the pilot's delayed decision to eject prior to exceeding the ejection seat envelope.  Also contributing to the accident was (1) the Navy's oversight environment, which did not require airman, aircraft, and risk management controls or standards expected of a commercial civil aviation operation, and (2) ATAC's organizational environment, which did not include CRM training to promote good aeronautical decision-making and ORM guidance to mitigate hazards.  Also contributing to the accident were the design features of the airplane, which were typical of its generation, including the lack of accurate fuel quantity indications, the design of the fuel transfer valve; and the maintenance program's lack of clearly documented procedures and type-specific training for the Hunter.","Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Decision making/judgment - Pilot, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - Lateral/bank control - Attain/maintain not possible, Aircraft - Fluids/misc hardware - Fluids - Fuel - Fluid management, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Incomplete action - Ground crew, Personnel issues - Task performance - Inspection - Preflight inspection - Pilot, Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Repair - Maintenance personnel, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Identification/recognition - Pilot, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Equipment/furnishings - Emergency equipment - Not used/operated, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Organizational issues - Management - Culture - Standard operating practices - Operator, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Fuel system - (general) - Design",,"34.118887999999998","-119.118888","HAWKER AIRCRAFT LTD","HAWKER HUNTER MK.58A","AIR","KNTD","Naval Air Station Point Mugu","false","1","TJ",,"PUBF","PUBU","Destroyed","VMC","ATAC","Approach","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=83685","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/83685/pdf"
