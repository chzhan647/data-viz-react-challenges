The initial damage to the fan blades was caused by the ingestion of a Red-Tailed Hawk that caused one or more fan blades to fracture, striking the fan case and causing it to bulge. The initial fan blade fragment release impacted and damaged other passing fan blades generating various sized blades fragments. Some of these blade fragments were propelled forward of the fan case by passing fan blades and were reingested, creating a cascading effect of collateral impact damage to the other fan blades, the fan case, and the inlet cowl.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Power plant - Engine cowling system - Damaged/degraded, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Power plant - Engine cowling system - Capability exceeded, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Compressor section - Damaged/degraded, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Compressor section - Capability exceeded, Environmental issues - Physical environment - Object/animal/substance - Animal(s)/bird(s) - Effect on equipment",,"39.749823999999997","-104.999977","BOEING","757-222","AIR","DEN","Denver International","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Minor",,"UNITED AIRlNES INC","Landing","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=81900","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/81900/pdf"

an aerodynamic stall and subsequent uncommanded roll during a one engine-inoperative takeoff flight test, which were the result of (1) Gulfstream’s failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds for the flight tests and recognize and correct the takeoff safety speed (V2) error during previous G650 flight tests, (2) the G650 flight test team’s persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve V2 speeds that were erroneously low, and (3) Gulfstream’s inadequate investigation of previous G650 uncommanded roll events, which indicated that the company’s estimated stall angle of attack while the airplane was in ground effect was too high. Contributing to the accident was Gulfstream’s failure to effectively manage the G650 flight test program by pursuing an aggressive program schedule without ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of team members had been appropriately defined and implemented, engineering processes had received sufficient technical planning and oversight, potential hazards had been fully identified, and appropriate risk controls had been implemented and were functioning as intended.","Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - Airspeed - Related operating info, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Aircraft capability - Engine out capability - Related operating info, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - Angle of attack - Related operating info, Personnel issues - Task performance - Use of equip/info - Use of equip/system - Flight crew, Organizational issues - Development - Selection/certification/testing - Equip certification/testing - Manufacturer, Organizational issues - Management - Scheduling - Task scheduling/workload - Manufacturer, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - Manufacturer, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Policy/procedure development - Manufacturer, Organizational issues - Management - Communication (organizational) - Between groups/organizations - Emergency services, Organizational issues - Management - Communication (organizational) - Between groups/organizations - Airport, Organizational issues - Management - Communication (organizational) - Between groups/organizations - Manufacturer, Organizational issues - Management - Resources - Availability of personnel - Airport, Environmental issues - Operating environment - Communication system - (general) - Not specified",,"33.292498999999999","-104.52527600000001","GULFSTREAM","GVI","AIR","ROW","Roswell Intl Air Center Airpor","false","2","TF",,"FLTS","091","Substantial","VMC","GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE CORPORATION","Takeoff","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=78738","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA11MA076.aspx"
