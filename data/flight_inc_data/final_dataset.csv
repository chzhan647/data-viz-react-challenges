Contributing to the probable cause was the lack of instructions to ensure the lock washer was installed in the J5 power terminal block in the Boeing 757 aircraft maintenance manual (AMM). 

Additionally, contributing to the incident was the deferral of the related maintenance write-up before the incident, which resulted from information in the United Airlines AMM that stated, “When bus bar(s) show signs of blackening or burning, the condition is acceptable for continued service, although the window must be replaced within 50 flight-hours.","Aircraft - Aircraft structures - Windows-windshield system - Flight compartment windows - Incorrect service/maintenance, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - Maintenance provider, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Oxygen system - Crew oxygen system - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - FAA/Regulator",,38.900085,-77.449478,BOEING,757,AIR,IAD,Washington Dulles,false,2,TF,SCHD,,121,Minor,,,Enroute,Completed,,Final,https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=76023,https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/76023/pdf,2010,,Boeing,5,16,22,Sunday

The HCF crack developed because of a mechanically coupled LPC stage 3 and stage 1 IBR mode excitation and blade flutter response. The excitation was driven by an acoustic tone generated by turbulent airflow passing over the 2.5 bleed valve duct cavity while the engine was operating at high speeds in specific flight conditions.

Contributing to the fan blade failure was the inadequate inspection of the blades, which failed to identify low-level indications of cracking, and the insufficient frequency of the manufacturer’s inspection intervals, which permitted the low-level crack indications to propagate undetected and ultimately resulted in the fatigue failure. Contributing to the severity of the engine damage following the fan blade failure was the design and testing of the engine inlet, which failed to ensure that the inlet could adequately dissipate the energy of, and therefore limit further damage from, an in-flight fan blade out event. Contributing to the severity of the engine fire was the failure of the “K” flange following the fan blade out, which allowed hot ignition gases to enter the nacelle and imparted damage to several components that fed flammable fluids to the nacelle, which allowed the fire to propagate past the undercowl area and into the thrust reversers, where it could not be extinguished.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Compressor section - Failure, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Equipment design - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft handling/service - Maintenance/inspections - Scheduled maint checks - Inadequate inspection, Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Compressor section - Fatigue/wear/corrosion",,39.929179,-104.96439,BOEING,777-222,AIR,,,false,2,TF,SCHD,,121,Minor,VMC,United Airlines,Initial Climb,Completed,,Final,https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=102652,https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/102652/pdf,2021,,Boeing,2,20,14,Saturday

Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industry's selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officer's aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response.

Contributing to the serious passenger injury was (1) the delay in shutting down the left engine and (2) a flight attendant's deviation from company procedures, which resulted in passengers evacuating from the left overwing exit while the left engine was still operating.
